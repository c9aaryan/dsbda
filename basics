2nd way... Easier

It is the easiest way to upload a CSV file in Colab.
For this go to the dataset in your GitHub repository, and then click on “View Raw”.
Copy the link to the raw dataset and pass it as a parameter to the read_csv() in pandas to get the dataframe. 

url = 'copied_raw_github_link'
df = pd.read_csv(url)

...read a dataset
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.read_csv("IRIS.csv")
print(df)
